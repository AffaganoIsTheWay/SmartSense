Overview

SmartSense is a technology aimed at detecting and displaying the Carbon Dioxide level (ppm), humidity and temperature. Developed using NordicThingy nrf52, NordicThingy:52 and BoosterpackXL kits in C language, it can be deployed by any operating system. SmartSense is great for people who like to keep a constant update of their environment's condition. The bluetooth sensor of the NordicThingy:52 allows us to actively update the state of the environment according to time of request. The display and joystick from the BoosterpackXL kit displays them in a clear and precise form, with the joystick allowing to shuffle to the parameter the user wants to see.
